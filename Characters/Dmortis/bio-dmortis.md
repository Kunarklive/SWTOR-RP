## Introduction
The galaxy shuddered under the weight of recent conflicts, scars etched across star systems from battles fought in the shadows. Amidst this turmoil stood a figure cloaked in obsidian robes, a spectral presence haunting the fringes of known space. Darth D'mortis, once a captive of the Nathema Cultist Faction, emerged from the shadows of a dark past to command a destiny bathed in mystery.

Born on the enigmatic world of Zakuul, D'mortis's journey began in the clutches of the Nathema Experiment, a nefarious ritual that sought to harness the very essence of the Force, during his knighthood serving the planet of Zakuul. Freed from the cultists' grasp by unforeseen circumstances, the dark-robed figure vanished into the unknown, leaving behind whispers of their enigmatic escape, forever changing the force wielding knight.

With the Sith Empire under the rule of Empress Acina, D'mortis emerged once more, their path intertwining with the dark threads of Sith politics. Rising through the ranks with an air of inscrutability, the figure wielded an influence that captivated allies and adversaries alike. However rumors began to surface. Whispers echoed across the stars of a fleet, wreathed in shadows, reemerging from the depths of oblivion. Reports trickled in, tales spun of a fleet bearing the mark of Darth D'mortis, navigating Sith and Republic space with an eerie presence, its purpose shrouded in obscurity.

## Facial Description:

### Complexion
Darth D'mortis possesses a pallid complexion, their skin an eerie canvas devoid of warmth or vitality. The pallor stands in stark contrast to the darkened, corrupted veins that meander beneath the surface, a visual testament to the Sith's malevolent influence coursing through their being.

### Eyes
Their eyes, tinged with the unmistakable hue of the dark side, blaze with the intense, predatory glint of a Sith. These Sith eyes pierce through the darkness, betraying an unnerving depth of power and malice that speaks volumes of the darkness that fuels their existence.

### Scars
A prominent, jagged scar mars the landscape of their visage, traversing diagonally across the right eye. The scar, a testament to past trials and battles, adds an intimidating edge to an already formidable countenance, etching a tale of resilience and ferocity upon their face.

### Hair
Long strands of silver hair cascade down like a shimmering waterfall, the smoothness of each strand reflecting a deceptive serenity amidst the darkness that engulfs their presence. The silver locks flow, framing the features of their face with an otherworldly elegance, a stark contrast to the ominous aura that surrounds them.
